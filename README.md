# Sonicore-energy-analytics
## 📖 Project Motivation
Smart homes generate massive IoT data. This project simulates energy usage across devices and homes to demonstrate how data analysts can uncover cost drivers, peak usage hours, and customer trends. It’s designed as a portfolio project to showcase SQL, Python, and Power BI skills.

## 🛠️ Workflow
1. **Data Generation** — Synthetic dataset created with Python (10,000+ rows).
2. **Data Storage** — Loaded into SQLite for relational modeling.
3. **Data Analysis** — SQL queries for device, region, and customer insights.
4. **Visualization** — Power BI dashboard with KPIs, charts, and interactive visuals.
5. **Storytelling** — Key insights documented for business decision‑making.

## 📊 Dashboard Preview

The dashboard includes:
- KPI cards for total energy and cost
- Device usage comparison
- Regional consumption treemap
- Residential vs Commercial split
- Hourly trend line

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/puppala/Sonicore-energy-analytics`
2. Open `energy_project.db` in SQLite or run queries in Colab.
3. Open `Sonicore_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
4. Explore visuals and apply filters.

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Add real IoT datasets for validation
- Deploy dashboard to Power BI Service
- Integrate predictive modeling (energy forecasting)
- Add slicers for deeper interactivity

## 🧑‍💻 Skills Demonstrated
- SQL (joins, aggregations, grouping)
- Python (data generation, ETL)
- Power BI (dashboard design, KPIs, storytelling)
- Data modeling (relationships, schema design)
- Business analysis (customer segmentation, cost drivers)
